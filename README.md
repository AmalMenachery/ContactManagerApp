# ContactManagerApp

A React Native Contact Manager App in iOS &amp; Android


# Comments for Reviewers

- This project is a minimal viable product (MVP), so components for Text, Button, and Image are not separated into the components folder.

- In a production environment, I would organize styles into separate files and establish a theme for consistent styling across the codebase.

- If the user has a contact with contact photo, that will be shown in the list and details screen.

- However, Updating the contact photo is currently not functional, because of limitations in the npm package used. In a real-world scenario, we could patch the npm package to resolve this issue, but this was beyond the scope of this task.

- I did not download the 'Agrandir, sans-serif' font for this project(so the styles for font won't work). Instead, I have attempted to loosely follow the HelloFresh theme.

## Actual Time

- 50 minutes to setup a new React-Native project and get things up & running
- 90 minutes to code, developer test the functionalities, look into the bug in the NPM package(react-native-contacts)
- 30 minutes to cleanup, review and add comments 

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
